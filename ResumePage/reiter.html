        <p>
          I joined Heinrich Reiter GmbH in 2017 and started in a combined warehouse and sales support role. Day to day, I handled goods-in and put-away, picked and packed customer orders, prepared labels and delivery notes, and made sure stock rotation (FIFO) was actually followed on the floor. I double-checked critical orders, helped with same-day shipments, and coordinated with sales whenever an item was urgent or a substitute had to be discussed with the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on I focused on product knowledge. Understanding categories, common accessories, and typical failure points made a big difference—not only for accuracy in picking, but also for better advice when colleagues or customers had questions. I took on special requests and B2B pick-ups, and I often bridged between front-of-house and the warehouse to keep things moving smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time I suggested a few practical improvements: small checklists for opening/closing routines, clearer bin labels for fast-movers, and lightweight cycle counts to catch discrepancies before they grew. Nothing flashy—just consistent habits that reduced mis-picks and helped new colleagues ramp up faster. I also kept quick reference notes for tricky items so anyone could find details without digging through systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cross-trained across all sub-areas—goods-in, high-bay, small parts, returns—so I could plug gaps when someone was out. That reliability mattered on busy days. On the customer side I handled warranty intake and “why is this delayed?” calls: staying calm, giving honest ETAs, and documenting the next step so nobody had to ask twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our team grew, I began coordinating shifts for 5–10 people, balancing speed with accuracy. I prioritized same-day shipments, trained new hires and apprentices, and covered vacations when needed. I’m careful about safety—especially with forklifts and heavy pallets—and I try to set a tone where people feel comfortable asking questions before a mistake happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognitions were simple but meaningful: steady pay increases, more responsibility, and trust. I was often asked to jump into whatever area was under pressure that week, and I became the person colleagues would ping when a process or label looked off. The team was never perfect—warehouses rarely are—but the atmosphere improved when we kept the basics clear and helped each other without drama.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, Heinrich Reiter GmbH taught me to combine discipline with pragmatism: move fast, but don’t skip the small checks that prevent big problems; write things down; and keep communication short and kind. Those habits still guide how I work today.

        From the start, more was expected of me than of others. I learned the full
        warehouse flow—goods-in, put-away, picking, packing—and helped on the customer
        side with special requests and warranty intake. I suggested small changes like
        clearer labels, simple checklists, and light cycle counts; they weren’t fancy,
        but they reduced mistakes and made onboarding easier.

        I cross-trained across all areas, covered busy shifts, and later coordinated a
        team of 5–10, balancing same-day shipments with accuracy and safety. I trained
        new hires, kept communication short and kind, and tried to fix root causes instead
        of just symptoms. Those habits—move fast, do the small checks, write things down—
        are still how I work today.
