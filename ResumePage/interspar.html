        <p>My time at Interspar was marked by some of the greatest challenges of my life. At 24 years old, I wanted to provide the best life financially for my wife and future children. To achieve that, I aimed to climb the career ladder as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
        <p>I started in the beverage department but soon moved to the fruit and vegetable department, where the prospects for advancement were best. We were a very young team and knew we wouldn’t be working together forever, since the entire store was scheduled for renovation. We were promised that the company would try to reassign as many employees as possible to other branches, and at the same time a new store was being built.</p>
        <p>I got along well with the team and managed to avoid getting involved in disputes among colleagues. After about six months, the final days of our branch approached. My department head and I were the only two employees the company wanted to retain, and I was given a position at the new branch that was opening.</p>
        <p>Hopes were high as we started in the new fruit and vegetable department with five colleagues, and I was appointed deputy department head. My responsibilities included organizing and restocking the department, keeping our storage area orderly, placing orders, assisting and advising customers, as well as leading and coordinating the team.</p>
        <p>Before I even started, I had been warned that our department head had a difficult personality. I took the job anyway because it offered the best career opportunities. Success did not come easily, and our team was quickly reduced to the legal minimum of three people. I was tasked with handling orders and taking charge whenever the department head was absent.</p>
        <p>Despite these setbacks, our team worked well together and supported each other. Internally, however, things in our department were difficult. Our head never seemed to consider anyone good enough, and the constant pressure meant that the third person in our team never stayed for long. On several occasions, the department head and I had to manage the department just the two of us for weeks at a time.</p>
        <p>Determined to provide a good life for my family despite my limited formal education, I forced myself to persevere. I received encouraging words and support from colleagues who understood the difficulties between my department head and me. Monday mornings were always the toughest part of the week — because of promotional changes over the weekend, the stock had to be almost completely replenished. For some reason, despite her decades of experience, my department head placed no value on preparing for Mondays. Eventually, I took the initiative to start preparations on Fridays and Saturdays so that we could finish earlier and more efficiently on Mondays.</p>
        <p>There were some successes during this time. Our branch manager — determined, extremely strict, yet fair — wanted to support me and sent me for internal training. At a talent day, I made a positive impression, and out of roughly 50 participants, about 20 of us (including me) were selected for training as “Top Salespeople” — a prerequisite at Interspar for eventually becoming a department head.</p>
        <p>As the months passed, the overall work improved, but working with my department head remained incredibly difficult. The original branch where I had started was about to reopen, and I saw it as my chance for better conditions. I secured a position in the newly reopened branch and, despite having more experienced colleagues there, I was reinstated as deputy.</p>
        <p>My training continued with several internal courses covering not only company policies but also teamwork and leadership. In the end, I completed the Top Salesperson course with distinction and had high hopes for my future at Interspar. In the new branch — with a new team and a new department head — the working environment and atmosphere improved significantly.</p>
        <img src="images/topverkaufer.jpg" alt="Topverkäufer-Zertifikat" class="top-seller-certificate">
        <p>However, gradually the same problem crept back in: the daily disrespect I had to endure from customers. The company’s new policy of “the customer is always right” didn’t sit well with me. Even in cases of outright rudeness, I was expected to agree, apologize, and basically thank the customer for their behavior.</p>
        <p>Over time, the work became increasingly hard to manage. Colleagues who left were not replaced, and the demands only grew. My new department head took it upon herself to train me further and prepare me to one day manage a department. While I appreciated the mentorship, it led to even more overtime and mounting stress.</p>
        <p>I wanted to protect my young family from my constantly changing work schedules, the uncertainty of when I’d be home, and my ongoing exhaustion. So I decided to look for a new job. I was convinced by then that the grocery retail sector was not for me.</p>
        <p>A pivotal moment came in late spring. While I was still working at Interspar and actively looking for a new challenge, my department head approached me. She told me she wanted to promote me further and even offered to coach me in her free time to help me learn faster. That was the moment of truth.</p>
        <p>I knew I wanted to leave and saw no future for myself at the company. I also realized that if I was honest with her, I would likely be given notice, leaving me little time to find another job. With a two-year-old daughter and a pregnant wife at home, I was very dependent on my income. I had to decide whether to continue in the job (while deceiving my boss) or to be honest and risk worsening our already difficult financial situation.</p>
        <p>I chose honesty and told her that I realized the job wasn’t for me and that I was searching for something new. My department head was understanding, but she informed me that July 31 would be my last day at that branch.</p>
        <p>In the following months, I worked diligently so as not to leave my colleagues in the lurch, all the while continuing my job hunt. My efforts paid off — about a month before my last day, I had two promising job offers. I chose the one that was most family-friendly, and in the years since, I’ve been greatly rewarded for that decision.</p>
        <p>My time at Interspar was filled with significant challenges, but also many wonderful moments and valuable experiences.</p>

        At 24, I aimed to climb the career ladder at Interspar to provide the best for my family. I started in the beverage department and soon moved to fruit & vegetables, where advancement opportunities were greatest. Despite initial success, a challenging work environment and a difficult department head made progress tough. My hard work was recognized, and I was promoted to deputy department head in a new branch, where I faced increased responsibilities and workload.

        Despite my efforts to plan ahead and improve efficiency, constant pressure and customer disrespect wore me down. With support from colleagues and corporate training, I completed the Top Salesperson course with distinction, hoping for a brighter future. However, persistent challenges and family needs led me to seek a new job. After being honest with my boss, I secured a more family-friendly position, leaving Interspar on good terms.
