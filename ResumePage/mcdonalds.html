        <p>My first steps into the working world began in the fall of 2009 at McDonald’s. Initially, it was just meant to fill the time until I began two years of missionary service. Approximately 20 hours of work per week were planned, but within a few months it turned into much more. During my first months, two very precise and strict ladies trained me in the mornings, yet they maintained a pleasant and friendly work atmosphere. Since I was young and had plenty of free time, I was soon moved to the night shift team. The stories about the night shift were partly true — working so late definitely had its own unique flair and rules.</p>

        <p>My tasks included operating the cash register, restocking supplies, and keeping the checkout area stocked with food and non-food items. During the day, I was an integral part of the drive-thru team. Because I enjoyed working with my team and believed in giving more than what was required whenever possible, I quickly became one of the first people they’d call on when extra help was needed. As a result, in the last four to six months of my first stint at McDonald’s, I was working almost full-time and accumulated nearly 100 hours of overtime — by far the most of anyone.</p>

        <p>Such a level of dedication wouldn’t be possible for me today, now that I’m older and have a family. But back then I was young, had the time, and really enjoyed working with that team. I still remember when I spontaneously asked for some vacation time, the assistant store manager said, “Of course – you are always there for us, so I am there for you.”</p>

        <p>In mid-October 2010, I was finally able to begin my missionary service. Many colleagues were sad to see me leave, but they were also happy for me and the opportunity I was pursuing for the next two years. (Little did anyone know there would be a reunion in the USA afterward!)</p>

        <p>In the winter of 2012, still unsure of what I wanted to do with my life, I returned to McDonald’s. My colleagues and I were delighted to work together again. There were many familiar faces and some new ones as well. A shift leader from my first time at McDonald’s — with whom I had a good relationship — had become the new store manager. The expectations on both sides were clear, and I enjoyed the same respect as before. After a few months, I decided to pursue a carpentry apprenticeship and started searching for a position while working full-time. I quickly found an apprenticeship, and it looked like I would soon be bidding farewell to my employer once more. I worked diligently until the end of June and made many new friends; some were sad to see me go, but they were also happy that I was taking a new path in life.</p>

        <p>That summer, I spent five weeks in the United States visiting old friends. Upon my return — full of anticipation for my carpentry apprenticeship — I learned that the company could no longer take me on. Because of my age, they would have had to pay me a higher apprentice wage, which they unfortunately couldn’t afford. I wanted to start something new where I could see a bright future for myself, so I began my job search. In mid-September, I unexpectedly received a call from my former store manager (and good friend) asking if I could come back one more time. The employee who opened the morning shift would be out for a few months, and they had also had to let go of a shift leader who was supposed to support the mornings. I was the only one who could step into the role quickly and seamlessly. So I came back for my third stint at McDonald’s. All the employees and shift leaders were very happy to see me again, and I returned with a bit of a special status — I was the only one who didn’t have to work weekends and always had the same schedule. My opinions were highly valued and readily accepted by the management team.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, I wasn’t truly happy there, as I wanted a job I enjoyed that also offered opportunities for advancement. The frequent disrespect from customers weighed on me. I completed an internal training to become a crew trainer and wanted to start an apprenticeship program that would allow me to finish my high school diploma and then go on to study. Unfortunately, the regional manager handled my apprenticeship placement too late, so I couldn’t start at the beginning of the school year. I felt stuck and became increasingly unhappy with my situation. In the meantime, I had gotten married, and it was clear that unemployment was not an option for me.</p>

        <p>A friend had recently begun working at Interspar, and his store manager was very pleased with him. Since retail always has high turnover, a position opened up fairly quickly. My friend recommended me, and I got the job. During my third period at McDonald’s, I had stayed for almost a year, but this time the departure was final. The send-off was grand because the team was fantastic. In all my previous workplaces (McDonald’s, Interspar, Heinrich Reiter GmbH), I never had such a close-knit team. If you made an effort to do the job right, you were immediately accepted by everyone, and everyone was willing to go the extra mile for each other. Even a year or two later, whenever I visited, I was still asked if I wanted to come back.</p>

        <p>My time at McDonald’s greatly shaped my attitudes toward work and developed many of my skills. I learned the importance of a supportive team, to work hard not just for money, and that a willingness to make sacrifices can really pay off.</p>

        I began working at McDonald’s in fall 2009, planning to work part-time until my two years of missionary service. Initially trained by two precise yet friendly mentors, I soon joined the night shift, which had its own unique atmosphere. My tasks included operating the register, restocking, and maintaining the checkout area. I quickly became a go-to person for help, working almost full-time with significant overtime.

        In October 2010, I started my missionary service, but returned to McDonald’s in winter 2012, unsure of my future. I enjoyed reconnecting with old colleagues and meeting new ones. After deciding to pursue a carpentry apprenticeship, I worked until June and made many friends. Unfortunately, the apprenticeship fell through for financial reasons, and I returned to McDonald’s for a third stint in September 2012, temporarily filling a crucial position.

        Despite being respected and valued, I wasn’t happy, as I wanted a job with opportunities for growth. Customer disrespect bothered me. I trained as a crew trainer and sought an apprenticeship to complete my high school diploma. However, the process was delayed and I couldn’t start in time. Married and needing an income, I found a new job at Interspar, where I stayed almost a year before leaving McDonald’s for good.

        My time at McDonald’s taught me the importance of a supportive team, working hard beyond monetary gain, and the value of dedication.
